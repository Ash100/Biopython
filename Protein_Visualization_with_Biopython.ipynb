    "# Protein Visualization with BioPython (NGL Viewer)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Prepared by* **Dr. Ashfaq Ahmad**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive Jupyter notebook tailored for teaching purposes by *Dr. Ashfaq Ahmad*. This notebook is designed to empower you with the skills needed for Protein Visualization and Image Exportâ€”a vital aspect of structural biology and molecular research.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of structural biology, the visualization of proteins and molecules is crucial for gaining insights into their structures and functions. There are several standalone packages available, such as PyMol, Discovery Visualizer, VMD, Rasmol, and more. However, using them often requires downloading and installing additional software, which can be a cumbersome process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Beauty of This Notebook**: It offers you a hassle-free, all-in-one solution! You won't need to spend time downloading and configuring external software. Instead, you can dive right into your protein visualization and image export tasks with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Kick Start**: This notebook serves as your launching pad for your protein-related projects. Whether you're a student, researcher, or enthusiast, you'll find valuable tools and techniques here to accelerate your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**No Time to Waste**: Let's get started! Connect to this notebook, and embark on your journey into the fascinating world of protein visualization and image export. Your discoveries await!\n",
